  <h1>Nacho Cheese</h1>  
  <img src="../img/nachocheese.jpg" width="300" alt="Nacho Cheese Sauce">

  <p>The good thing about cheese sauce is that it makes everything it touches so much more delicious: French fries, chips, baked potatoes, meat (think about the cheesesteaks). Even broccoli is better with cheese. But the bad thing about cheese sauce is that it becomes unappetizing and congealed in almost no time flat.</p>

    <p>Enter the kitchen geniuses over at Modernist Cuisine, who have gifted the world a way to keep cheese forever melty by using sodium citrate, a naturally occurring preservative found in citrus fruits.</h3></p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>285 grams (about .625 pounds) sharp cheddar, grated</li>
    <li>11 grams sodium citrate (or 2 teaspoons of citric acid + 2.5 teaspoons of baking soda)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 jalapeños, finely diced</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Add sodium citrate or citric acid/baking soda mixture to water, and stir well to dissolve completely.</li>
    <li>Add in milk and bring liquids to a simmer over medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Add in cheese in small batches, whisking constantly. When all cheese is incorporated and fully melted, add in jalapeños, stir well and serve! Cheese will thicken slightly as it cools but will still be pourable at room temperature. This will keep for a week in the fridge.</li>
  </ol>
